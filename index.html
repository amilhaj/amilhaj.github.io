                <p>Quite often, people ask themselves how they could be successful in a certain field. How could they be succesful in their career? How could they be succesful in their life? In their projects? School? For whatever it may be, they all seek for a technical solution. A higher paying job. Getting a higher grade in school. Being recognized for a project. One thing is common among all these, and it is the idea of improvement. This, I believe, is the essence of success.</p>
                <p>We have all felt a time when we have hit a wall. A stage where our growth has plateaud. Think back to what you felt then. Frustration. Boredom. Displeasure. However, when we overcame that wall, when we were finally able to improve ourselves, a sense of relief, happiness, washed over us. As humans, we are hardwired to adapt and to improve. It is our human nature to desire to grow in every aspect of our lives. This is no different from what I aim for in life, especially in the following three aspects.</p>
                <p>Stress is a negative state of mind. No productivity is gained from moments of stress. Thus, it is important that one must be able to maintain their levels of stress. This can be done through knowing one's limits, and how to calm one's mind. I am guilty of being unable to do these two effectively. This much I know from my experience with work and exams. But through experience and practice, I am sure I will be able to handle stress much more effectively.</p>
                <p>As I stated earlier, humans are hardwired to adapt and improve. This has proved necessary for our survival, both as a species and as people of society. In the workplace, the environment is constantly changing, and we must constantly adapt to keep up with it. Though not horrible at it, I aim to improve my speed to adapt to my environments as it is important in my line of work. No two problems are exactly the same, and they will always require a different way of thinking to solve. To develop this skill is to be more successful as an Engineer.</p>
                <p>Finally, I want to improve on my ability to "think outside the box". Besides technical knowledge, a sense of creativity is beneficial in my line of work. There is no straight solution to any problem, no guideline to help me find a solution. It is important that I know how to create my own solutions, and this will require me to be able to see problems from all perspectives. By improving in this aspect, I will also improve my critical thinking and problem solving.</p>
