                <p>I am Joshua Amilhasan, a 4th year York University student currently studying Computer Engineering. I
                    was born in Philippines, Quezon City on December 1st, 1998. A year after I was born, my family moved
                    to United Arab Emirates, Dubai, where I spent most of my childhood. In 2009, my family moved to
                    Canada, Toronto, where I now currently reside.
                    <p>My main hobbies include longboarding, playing the guitar and drums, and writing short stories for
                        my blog. I picked up longboarding around the beginning of September, guitars about a year ago,
                        drums about two years ago, and my writing two years ago. I tend to pick up new and interesting
                        hobbies frequently because I am a curious person who is always willing to learn new things and
                        expand my horizons.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned, I am an Engineering student of York University. I attended this school because of
                        the reputable programs it had for Engineering, especially Aerospace Engineering. Computer
                        Engineering became my choice of engineering discipline because I had always been interested in
                        computer programming and hardware. Though the program is quite difficult, I believe this
                        challenge is necessary to teach students the value of hard work, initiative, and organization;
                        values that are important not just in an academic environment, but also in all aspects of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>Though my passion is in Computer Engineering, it was not always so. What inspired me to proceed
                        down the path of a Computer Engineer was my high-school teacher for Computer Science. He made
                        learning about computers and programming interesting and easy to learn. It was in that class
                        with him as my teacher that opened my eyes to the world of programming and deepened my curiosity
                        to learn more about it. He was also the first teacher to recognize my passion and talent for
                        computers and recommended that I study Computer Engineering in university. It was thanks to him
                        that I am now studying my current program with a clear goal for my future.</p>
                    <p>To share a favourite quote from my inspiring teacher, “My day is better than yesterday, but worse
                        than tomorrow.” He often said this in response to us asking how his day has been. This witty
                        remark always stuck to me as it reminds me that tomorrow will always be better. This inspired me
                        to be an optimist in life, to always look forward and to improve myself for the better.</p>
